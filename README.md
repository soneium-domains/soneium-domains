We are in the process of creating comprehensive developer documentation for Soneium Domains. While we work on delivering detailed guides, developers can utilize the existing Ethereum Name Service (ENS) documentation to interact with our service, as our smart contract functions closely mirror the ENS structure. This means you can begin building with Soneium Domains immediately, leveraging your familiarity with ENS while awaiting our full-fledged documentation. Soneium Domains is fully compatible with the ENS (Ethereum Name Service) architecture.
